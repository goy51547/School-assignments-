School Assignments
==========
This repository contains programming assignments from the various computer science courses I've completed during my time at Washington University in St. Louis.  Its purpose is three-fold.  First, it provides me an opportunity to keep my code under source code control for future reference.  Second, it gives a demonstrable overview of my technical skills.  Finally, it allows for a perspective on how my skills have progressed over time.

### Computer Science I (CSE 131) ###

_Course description:_ Introductory course in computer science.  Covered basic programming techniques, loops, recursion, basic data structures, polymorphism, and object-oriented programming.

_Professor:_  [Ron K. Cytron] (http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~cytron/)

_Language Used:_  Java

_Final Course Grade:_  A+

_Taken_ Spring 2015


### Object Oriented Software Development Laboratory (CSE 332S) ###

_Course description:_   Intensive focus on practical aspects of designing, implementing and debugging object-oriented software.  Special focus on design and implementation based on frameworks, as they are central themes enabling the construction of reusable, extensible, efficient, and maintainable software.

_Professors:_   [Dr. Christoper Gill](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~cdgill/),  Dr. Ruth Miller

_Course Site:_   http://classes.cec.wustl.edu/~cse332/

_Language(s) Used:_   C++

_Final Course Grade:_   B

_Taken_ Spring 2014

### Advanced Algorithms (CSE 441T) ###

_Course description:_   An advanced course on the topic of algorithms and data sturctures.  The majority of the course introduces and analysis some famous algorithms like Greedy and Dynamic Programming.

_Professors:_   [Robert Pless](http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/)

_Course Site:_   http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~pless/441/

_Language(s) Used:_   N/A

_Final Course Grade:_   A-

_Taken_ Fall 2015

### Introduction to Artifical Intelligence (CSE 511A)  ###

_Course description:_   An advanced course on the topic of Machine Learning.  The majority of the course is a thorough overview of Supervised Learning, including popular algorithms like decision trees and variants, nearest neighbors, ANNs, etc, but also theoretical implications of supervised learning approaches such as the bias-variance decomposition and the bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, etc.  The end of the course was a survey of dimensionality reduction methods, comparison of machine learning approaches (e.g. frequentist vs. bayesian, etc), gaussian processes and bayesian optimization, and generative mixture models and applications, like clustering.

_Professors:_   [Roman Garnett](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/)

_Course Site:_   http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/cse511a/

_Language(s) Used:_   Python

_Final Course Grade:_   A-

_Taken_ Fall 2015
